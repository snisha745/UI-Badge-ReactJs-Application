                                A technical method to remedy security gaps in an organization's IT infrastructure is VAPT certification (application, software system, network etc.). The process of vulnerability assessment involves identifying with the aim of not missing any gaps. A penetration test will be performed based on the severity of the Vulnerability Assessment findings. A penetration test is a method for exploring and exploiting vulnerabilities in-depth. This technique both establishes the existence of the vulnerability and shows that harm to the application or network could result from its exploitation. The PT process is generally intrusive and can harm the systems; screen-shots or logs are taken as proof of this, which further helps with remediation. <br /> <br />
